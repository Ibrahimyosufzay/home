       <h1> Afghanistan </h1>
		<p>Afghanistan also known as the Islamic Repulic of Afghanistan.There are four different types of people in Afghanistan.
		 These four different types of people are Tajik, Pashtun, Hazara and Ozbek.These are the four main ethnic groups. There are many more other
		 types of people in Afghanistan such as Turkman, Balochi tribe, Aimaq people, Nuristanis, Farsiwan and etc. There is currently a war going on 
		in Afghanistan where everyday everybody is stuggling to stay alive with mostly everyone in poverty and people getting killed by bombs or
		discrimination. Afghanistan is part of the middle east. Afghanistan is composed of mountains and flat lands. Homes are made from mud walls.
		Nowadays you see more people living on mountains because it is more cheaper than living near homes. Living on mountains is very hard.
		You constantly have to climb down the mountains to go to work or get groceries. Going down is way easier, but when it is time to go back 
		up the mountain to get back to your home after a long hot day its pretty hard. Finding a job is very hard. You either have to sell food 
        or you have to sell your old clothing. Even when you try to sell food or old clothing its very hard to make a profit because rarely anbody
        will come to buy your old clothing or the food you have made. About 90% of citizens of Afghanistan are going through poverty while about
        10% of the population is doing alright.</p>
